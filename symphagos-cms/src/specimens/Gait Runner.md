specimenNumber: 2
name: "Gait Runner"
class: "Species"
<p>description: "4000 earth cycles after Eadweard Muybridge masterfully mesmerized us with mathematical motion capture, a new Symphagos species of quantizeable quadruped now captures my curiosity.</p>

<p>Introducing Gait runner, an equine effect that encourages experimentation straight out of the gate.</p>

<p>Echoing the rhythms of Muybridge’s mathematics, Gait Runner has two modes: walk and gallop, but this stuttery stampeder is not merely a one trick pony.</p>

<p>Observe the oodles of options to oscillate this undulating ungulate. Play with pitch, vary velocity, fine tune filtering, randomize rhythm, and more.</p>

<p>Sync this syncopated stallion to your tempo, or let this rhythmic racehorse run free, but either way, enjoy it for free, my dear disc jockeys.</p>

<p>Blaze new trails with Gait Runner.</p>"

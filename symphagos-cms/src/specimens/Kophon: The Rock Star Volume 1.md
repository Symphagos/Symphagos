description: "<p>As I descended deep into the Blumooda system, seasoned star haulers warned of a perilous pentangle known as the flat five, drenched in devilish dissonance. Deliverance from its discordant depths remains…unresolved.</p><p>And those bold enough to brave the Blumooda Pentangle must face the wrath of Kophon&#58; The Rock Star.</p><p>If Symphagos is the birther of biology sustained by sound, Kophon, its sinister sun, is the salient sonic silencer. Sound and silence, life and death, daisy-chained in a delicate duet.</p><p>Opportunely, the orbital oscillation of Symphagos saved my ship from scalding slaughter.</p><p>Subsequently, I mobilized a monitoring module to document this diabolical disk of destruction on whose heat I now definitively depend.</p<p>Venture into the volatile vault of volume 1.</p><p>~ Dr. Dara Dawes</p><p>Earth cycle 5878, moon cycle 1</p><p>Contains 78 dark cinematic ambient samples from the Blumooda system.</p><br>48khz 24bit wav  804.9 MB</br>"
